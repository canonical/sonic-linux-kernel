Subject: [PATCH] mtd: m25p80 spi driver update to support ACPI table match

Current m25p80 spi nor driver does not support ACPI table match.
Configuration done through ACPI tables is not recognized by driver.
Cisco 8000 platform configures NOR flash partition information
through ACPI table which is not recognized by m25p80.

Added support in m25p80 to perform ACPI table match.
